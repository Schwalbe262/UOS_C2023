I've come to you in the wake of recent events to issue a call to reason.
Let no human deny the perils of our time.
While we battle one another, divided by the petty strife of our common history,
the tide of greater conflict is turning against us,
threatening to destroy all that we have accomplished.
It is time for us as nations and as individuals to set aside our long-standing feuds and unite.
The tides of an unwinnable war are upon us, and we must seek refuge on higher ground, lest we be swept away by the flood.
